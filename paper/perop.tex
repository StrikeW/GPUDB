\section{Operator-level Comparison}

There has been considerable research on optimizing standard relational operators
for cpu-based and gpu-based databases. In this section, we compare the 
performance of running project, select, join, group-by and sort operations on the 
GPU versus running them on the CPU. In all cases, we assume that the data is
already in the device memory.
